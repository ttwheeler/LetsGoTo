# LetsGoTo
Group travel planning with voting, price splitting, and easy sharing. I decided to build this app after planning a few trips with my friends and relying primarily on group messages, which make discussion easy but planning difficult. The goal is to have a simple, sharable, mobile-first webpage for a trip - anyone you share it with can add and vote on hotels/AirBnBs/restaurants/activities.

## What it Does
In the current state a user can create a new trip or join an existing one, and add / vote on items. New features coming soon:
* Authentication and Roles
* Mobile display polishing
* In-place editing for list items
* Permanent deployed address

## Tech Stack
**Front End**
* React
* Bootstrap
* MUI
**Back End**
* Express
* MongoDB w/ Monoose

A quick note on tech stack decisions: I used React / Express as a base, Bootstrap and MUI for consistent and flexible UI design, and MongoDB with a Mongoose schema for a simple document storage setup.
